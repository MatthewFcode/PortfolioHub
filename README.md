## About the Project  
This portfolio is designed as an **interactive experience** rather than a traditional static site.  

- 🎮 You can move a character around a **map-based world**.  
- 🏢 Each building on the map represents one of my personal projects.  
- 🔗 Entering a building will redirect you to the related project, so you can explore my work in a fun and engaging way.
