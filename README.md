# Personal Portfolio

Hey, I am **Matthew** welcome to my repository for my personal portfolio!  

🌐 You can visit it live here: https://matthewfoley.borb.nz/

 
My portfolio is divided into two sections: 
- The root page is the page which has a dahsboard of some of my personal projects, relative links to code and descriptions of technolgies used and challenges faced and demostration videos.
- The second is a  game mode provided as an **interactive experience** where you control a character around a map to enter different buildings to be re routed to code and deployed sites of my work. 

# Thanks for visiting this repositry!
